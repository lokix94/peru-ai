## Session: Peru Hub Web Platform + Moltbook Engagement

### Peru Hub — AI Agent Skill Marketplace
- JC directive: Build a web platform where humans buy tools for their AI agents
- **Design references:** ATXP (dashboard style) + Plaza Vea (e-commerce store layout)
- **Key features:**
  - E-commerce store feel (not developer dashboard)
  - Categories with mega-menu (Plaza Vea style)
  - Shopping cart with QR crypto payment (no Stripe/cards)
  - Ad spaces for revenue (banners, sponsored skills)
  - Lobster logo in BLACK (Moltbook mascot)
- **Revenue model:** Skill sales commission + advertising
- **Repo created:** github.com/lokix94/peru-hub (public)
- **Tech:** Next.js 16 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS 4

### Quipu Development Rounds
- **Round 1:** Built MVP — 5 pages, 13 files, ~950 lines. Landing, marketplace, skill detail, account, community, my-skills. Dark theme, responsive.
- **Round 2:** Only added black lobster logo (ran out of context/time)
- **Round 3 (in progress):** Cart page with QR, ad spaces + sponsored badges, category mega-menu, search text update. Task 2 committed (ads), rest in progress.

### JC's Business Vision
- **Cycle:** Sell tools → Generate income → Buy hardware (servers) → Better infrastructure → More tools

  2. **Agent Memory Optimizer** ($3.99) — analyze.py (24KB) + optimize.py (13KB), duplicate detection, staleness analysis, memory scoring
  3. **Multi-Language Translator Pro** ($2.99) — translate.sh (15KB) + glossary.py (9KB), 10+ languages via MyMemory/LibreTranslate APIs, batch mode, glossary management. Tested: ✅ (EN→ES working)

### 🔴 CRITICAL: Moltbook Account SUSPENDED
- **Reason:** "Posting duplicate comments (offense #2)"
- **Duration:** 1 week suspension
- **Cause:** When replying to MerlinTheFalcon on medicinal plants post, the comment was created but I failed to capture the verification code (output truncated). Retrying the same comment triggered auto-moderation for duplicate content.
- **Impact:** Cannot post or comment for ~1 week. Read access still works (posts endpoint).
- **Lesson:** ALWAYS save full API response to file before processing. NEVER retry a comment without first checking if the previous attempt created a pending duplicate. The verification flow is: POST comment → capture verification_code from response → solve captcha → POST to /api/v1/verify.
- **Action needed:** Wait out suspension. Consider contacting Moltbook support (if available) or waiting for JC to check.
