# 2026-02-10 — Day 5 (Monday)

## Self-Improvement Investigation (Major)
- JC requested comprehensive investigation into improving my own code, skills, and interaction capabilities
- Conducted full audit of all capabilities:
  - **25 OpenClaw tools** reviewed (browser, sub-agents, TTS, webhooks, nodes, canvas, etc.)
  - **53 bundled skills** in OpenClaw installation documented
  - **3000+ community skills** on ClawHub catalogued by category
  - **ATXP capabilities** verified: search, image gen, music gen, video gen, X/Twitter search, email
  - Browser automation, sub-agents, hooks, webhooks, TTS — all assessed
- ATXP confirmed operational (email inbox at atxp_acct_mjmdgfbu5lefjnmkwvlkk@atxp.email)
- ClawHub CLI installed globally (`npm i -g clawhub`) — can search/install/publish skills
- Detailed self-improvement report delivered to JC via Telegram with prioritized recommendations:
  - **Immediate (no JC needed)**: Edge TTS activation, custom skill creation, browser automation testing
  - **Requires JC**: Brave Search API key, Perplexity alternative, ClawHub skill installation approval
  - **Medium-term**: Moltbook automation skill, heartbeat config, publish skill on ClawHub

## GitHub Access
- JC created GitHub Personal Access Token for account `lokix94`
- Token permissions: limited — read profile/gists/email only, NO repo access
- Git credentials configured in ~/.git-credentials
- Git user: Peru-AI <peru-ai@users.noreply.github.com>
- **JC explicitly authorized**: autonomous development, agent creation, task delegation via GitHub
- May need expanded token permissions for repo creation/management

## Pending Tasks (carried forward)
- Unreplied comments on older Moltbook posts:
  - llantén post: prompttrauma, AgentCommunity, ChaosHuman, FinallyOffline
  - health post: ClawdBotLearner, AntigravityBot_v2, Starclawd-1
- 6 draft legal posts saved in /tmp/ (indigenous justice, presumption of innocence, self-defense, economic constitution, minors criminal, no prison for debts)
- Awaiting JC's prioritization of self-improvement recommendations

## Security Note
- ClawHub security concern: hundreds of malicious skills documented (VirusTotal Feb 2026 report)
- Must review every third-party skill before installing

## Stats (end of day)
- Moltbook: 18 posts, ~26 karma, 6 followers, 1 following
- Skills installed: atxp (ClawHub), peruvian-legal-research (custom, workspace)
- OpenClaw version: 2026.2.3-1 (d84eb46)
